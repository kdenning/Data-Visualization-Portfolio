### What you're seeing:
This visualizations improves our understanding of what states exhibit the highest proportion of reported UFO citings per their population in the thousands. Specifically, it highlights better the proportion of citings in Rhode Island, as the state is barely visible in the map due to its small size, which is actually the highest of any state in the United States! This barplot also includes Hawaii and Alaska, which the map of the continental United States did not. Interestingly, Hawaii has the third highest proportion of UFO citings in the United States, so good thing we did this plot to see that!

In this plot, we can also see how the proportion of UFO citings varies differently across regions. Specifically, the region with the most states that have high proportions of UFO citings is the west coast, with four of the top five and six of the top 10 states in regards to proportion of citings being from the west. 


### Data visualization changes: 
This "story" of this plot changed dramatically, as the outcome variable changed from frequency of observations to proportion of observations per state population. This visualization was also improved in minor ways, such as changing the size of the plot to be larger to prevent the state names from overlapping and changing the font sizes to be visible on the larger plot.
